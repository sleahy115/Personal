  <h1>Coding Bootcamps</h1>
  <p>
    With recent news about some of the<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-12-unable-to-reach-a-sustainable-business-model-dev-bootcamp-will-shut-down-in-december"> oldest coding boot camps going out of business,</a> I thought I would reflect
    on my boot camp experience as a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> a 7-month coding boot camp in Portland OR. I know there are some who are saying that the coding boot camps are a fad and point to the closing of Dev
    Bootcamp as an example. While I can understand the concern I think it just points to the fact that the market has become oversaturated with these programs and in my opinion that is for good reason. I found my experience overall to be a good one. I
    got structure, the ability to work with some fantastic classmates, and I was introduced to tools and methodologies that I wouldn't have found otherwise.<br> Before deciding to attend Epicodus I had tried to learn to code by using free online programs
    like Code Academy. While I thought the program was a good one I found I needed more structure and support to truly learn. I needed to have a place where I was expected to be every day at a certain time with nothing else to focus on except coding.
    I also needed classmates and teachers to help me through the process. When I tried to learn completely on my own I found that I would get discouraged when I got stuck. In the boot camp, I not only had classmates and a teacher I could ask for guidance.
    I also found it reassuring to see other students struggle with and eventually overcome roadblocks just like I did. It made me feel much less alone and less likely to get discouraged.<br>Now you may say that if structure and support were what I was
    looking for why didn't I attend a traditional university? I did take a few coding classes at my community college and while they gave me some good information and a place to start, they did not give me as much real world type programming experience.
    I also found out later that they were leaving out many new frameworks and tools since traditional college programs are not as quick to adapt as boot camps. For example none of my programming classes ever mentioned git or any version control program,
    nor was there any mention of frameworks like Angular or Ember in my JavaScript class. I do intend to go back to college to finish my B.S in Computer Science eventually, but I think that college and boot camps address two different needs.<br>As far
    as the boot camp itself there are definitely pros and cons. I looked at programs all over the country when trying to find the right fit for me. Overall the biggest con for anyone considering attending a coding boot camp is cost. Many of these programs
    are expensive and traditional student loans can't be used, though I hope that changes soon. There is also the consideration of time. In my opinion, you need to go full time and basically live and breathe code during the program. Many students will
    find it difficult to take so much time off of work as well as shoulder the cost of attendance. The pros are that you can learn an amazing amount in a relatively short time. I learned two programming languages as well as multiple frameworks. I was
    able to create a portfolio and work on a live site during my internship. I left the program feeling capable and ready to enter the work force. <br>Overall I think coding boot camps can be a great path for some, of course, it is not for everyone. If
    federal accreditation, as well as the option for federal student loans, come to pass these programs can help a lot of people. What I particularly like about boot camps is that they have the possibility of adding diversity to the tech industry. If
    more people from different backgrounds can break into the industry it will be better for us all.</p>
