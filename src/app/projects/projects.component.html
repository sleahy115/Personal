<h1>Project Examples</h1>

<h2>Grab A Bag </h2>
<h4>This Drupal 7 site is designed to take the stress out of planning for a vacation. The user will enter the duration of the trip and few activities that they enjoy and the site will return a personalized itinerary.  The itinerary takes into account the users mode of transportation and looks for activities in walking, driving, or in transit distance. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to plan a fun and stress-free trip. This project features several custom modules, the Google Places API and uses the Bootstrap theme.</h4>
